## Project Description
Our goal is to develop an open-source ASIC for auto aligner. In our demonstraction we are targeting optical probe stations where it reads photodetector signals, extracts vibration-synchronous alignment error from dither motion, estimates the peak offset, and drives a high speed and accuracy real-time alignment correction.

## Problem Statement
Photonic packaging and integration are becoming increasingly important as Co-Packaging Optics (CPO) grows, but scalable alignment and testing remain difficult. Current alignment approaches are often specialized and not yet built for high-volume throughput.

High-volume CPO production may require hundreds of active alignments per module, scaling to millions of modules per month in large fabs. Existing setups typically rely on expensive, discrete desktop instrument boxes with proprietary hardware controllers and separate optical power meters.

There is a clear need for a low-cost hardware solution that performs alignment-error processing close to the sensor—enabling nanometer-precision alignment under real-time environmental disturbance, mechanical drift, and tight timing constraints.

## Value Preposition
Our ASIC provides an open-source, edge-processed feedback control loop for optical probe stations. By moving error demodulation and computation from external software into localized hardware, we eliminate data-bus latency and substantially improve alignment speed.

This offers a low-cost, integrable alternative to proprietary alignment hardware.
